# Regression Algorithms from Scratch

This repository contains Python implementations of core regression and classification algorithms built entirely from scratch. The aim is to gain a deep understanding of how these models work internally — without relying on machine learning libraries like `scikit-learn`.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- (Optional) Matplotlib — for plotting results

Install dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
